questions to ask:
    - with Cards.js and Tables.js, how do I tie card and description to the table #?
    - same for standings and playerRow once I add a loop - how does this.props.name know which user to pull??
    - in History/HistoryRow, Does each hand have to be its own "Store" with an action to create new hand.
